        <h1>THE IRON CURSE</h1>

        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>You still aren't sure how... but you are cursed.</p>
        <p>Late one evening, sitting alone in your apartment, the door was suddenly kicked in.  The first shock was quickly overcome by a second when you realized standing in the shattered doorway was none other than former Heavyweight World Champion Boxer Iron Tyke! The third shock was when he proceeded to beat you into a bloody pulp.  After what seemed like eternity, his demeanor suddenly shifted.  Rage turned to confusion, and after a moment of surveying the scene, he sprinted out.</p>
        <p>You only remember short blurs from the week or so after that.  Calling 911, the ambulance ride to the hospital, the police laughing in your face when you described the perpetrator.  You even started to doubt your own memories.  That was, until the forth shock came.  On your way to a therapist to try to sort out what happened, when suddenly there, standing at the end of the street...</p>
        
        <h2>The Curse</h2>
        <p>An ancient and dangerous curse has befallen you.  Randomly once every Lunar Cycle, Iron Tyke is drawn to you, possessed by rage.  Somehow, he always knows exactly where you are at.  Somehow, you are always caught alone.  Somehow, camera footage is always corrupted or missing.</p>
        <p>But finally, after a full year of this onslaught, you have convinced him to talk to you.  To discuss the curse, and if there is anyway to lift it...</p>

        <h2>The Adventure</h2>
        <p>A 2D isometric pixel graphics call back game to the cartridge era.  Inspired by games like NES Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Scott Pilgrim vs The World, and Akane.  Upgraded to include ARPG leveling elements to improve speed, stamina, health, and attacks.  A world spanning adventure as you travel the globe with your new unlikely ally, fighting off cultists and the paparazzi to uncover the origins of this terrible curse.</p>
